Description
-----------------

This repo contains a plugin for managing SGOL layers in QGIS.  Spatial Graph Operations Language (SGOL) is a high-level language for describing graph operations, with a focus on spatial data. This graph language follows many of the design conventions of the common SQL. The syntax will be familiar, but the actual reserved words are different.
